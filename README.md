## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Version Control & Sync Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: This repository MUST be kept synchronized with GitHub at all times.

### Sync Protocol:

1. **After EVERY change**: Commit and push to GitHub immediately
2. **Before starting work**: Always pull latest changes
3. **Working directory**: Use `repo-clone-buddy-friend/` as the primary development directory
4. **No desync allowed**: GitHub is the single source of truth

```bash
# Always follow this workflow:
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive message"
git push origin main
```

## ðŸ”¥ Immediate Issues to Address

### High Priority Fixes Required:

1. **Community Posts Issues**:
   - Comments being counted as posts in some queries
   - Image/video/poll posts not displaying correctly
   - Missing multimedia data in post details
   - `/comunidade/:post-id` route data loading issues

2. **Tag System**:
   - Missing color column in Tags table
   - Tag analytics function errors
   - Tag filtering not working properly

3. **Security Warnings**:
   - 20 functions need explicit search_path set
   - rate_limit_log table needs RLS policies

### Testing Requirements:

- All fixes MUST be tested using Supabase MCP tools
- Simulate actual app calls before marking as complete
- Verify data integrity after each change
