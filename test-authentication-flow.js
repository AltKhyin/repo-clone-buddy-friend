🧪 AUTHENTICATION INTERLUDE INTEGRATION TEST
=============================================

✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE! Here's what was implemented:

📋 FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
1. ✅ Dynamic step flow system (plan_selection → authentication → payment_details)
2. ✅ Email account detection with caching
3. ✅ Inline authentication (login/signup) within payment flow
4. ✅ Seamless state preservation across authentication steps
5. ✅ Automatic step flow adaptation based on user status

🔄 USER FLOWS SUPPORTED:
1. Logged-in user → Direct to payment (2 steps)
2. Existing account user → Login prompt → Payment (3 steps)  
3. New user → Account creation → Payment (3 steps)

🎯 TESTING SCENARIOS:

To test the implementation:

1. 🟢 LOGGED-IN USER FLOW:
   - User already logged in
   - Should see: Dados → Pagamento (2 steps)
   - No authentication step shown

2. 🟡 EXISTING ACCOUNT FLOW:
   - User not logged in, but email has account
   - Should see: Dados → Login → Pagamento (3 steps)
   - Authentication step shows "Fazer Login" with password field

3. 🔵 NEW USER FLOW:
   - User not logged in, email has no account
   - Should see: Dados → Criar Conta → Pagamento (3 steps)
   - Authentication step shows "Criar Conta" with password + confirm fields

⚙️  SUPABASE CONFIGURATION REQUIRED:
Please configure in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings:
- ❌ Disable "Enable email confirmations"
- ❌ Disable "Enable 2FA"  
- ✅ Set minimum password length to 8 characters
- ✅ Enable "Allow signups"

🧪 MANUAL TESTING STEPS:
1. Open payment form in browser
2. Fill customer data with different email scenarios:
   - Known existing email (should trigger login step)
   - New email (should trigger signup step)
   - Test while logged in (should skip auth step)
3. Verify step progression works correctly
4. Test authentication success → payment step transition
5. Test back button navigation between steps

📊 MONITORING:
Check browser console for detailed step flow logs:
- "Determining step flow for auth status: [status]"
- "Step flow updated: {...}"
- "Authentication successful: [userId]"

🎉 READY FOR TESTING!
The authentication interlude is now fully integrated into the payment flow.
