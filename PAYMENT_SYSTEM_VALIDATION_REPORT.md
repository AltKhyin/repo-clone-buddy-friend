## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture Summary

### **Payment Flow Intelligence**
```typescript
// Automatic routing based on plan configuration
const flow = analyzePaymentFlow(plan)
// 'subscription' â†’ evidens-create-subscription
// 'one-time'    â†’ evidens-create-payment
```

### **Subscription Lifecycle Management**
```typescript
// Advanced event processing with business logic
const result = SubscriptionEventProcessor.processSubscriptionEvent(
  'subscription.charged',
  eventData,
  userId
)
// Handles: welcome emails, feature activation, dunning, analytics
```

### **Real-time Analytics**
```typescript
// Comprehensive subscription monitoring
const monitoring = useSubscriptionMonitoring()
// Provides: MRR, churn rate, health scores, LTV calculations
```
