# EVIDENS Technical Debt Registry

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 3, 2025  
**Purpose:** Systematic tracking of technical debt items identified during documentation audit

---

## üìä Executive Summary

This registry documents technical debt items discovered during the comprehensive documentation audit of July 2025. Items are prioritized by impact on development velocity and maintenance burden.

## üî• High Priority Technical Debt

### 1. **Editor Blueprint Consolidation** ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT

**Issue:** 3 separate editor blueprint files with overlapping/conflicting information
**Files Affected:**

- `docs/blueprints/08a_EDITOR_BLUEPRINT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/blueprints/08a_EDITOR_BLUEPRINT_PODUCT&DESIGN.md`
- `docs/blueprints/8a_EDITOR_BLUEPRINT_TECH_STACK.md`

**Impact:** Developer confusion, inconsistent implementation patterns
**Recommendation:** Merge into single comprehensive `08a_EDITOR_BLUEPRINT.md`

### 2. **README-B√çBLIA Refactoring** ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT

**Issue:** 1000+ line omnibus document attempting to be everything
**Problems:**

- Visual Composition Engine roadmap mixed with project status
- Technical debt tracking scattered throughout
- Multiple authority claims conflicting with [DOC_X] series

**Impact:** Information overload, unclear authority hierarchy
**Recommendation:** Break into focused documents with clear responsibility boundaries

### 3. **Testing Framework Claims Misalignment** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Issue:** ~~Multiple documents claimed "260+ tests" when reality was 73 test files~~
**Status:** **RESOLVED** - Fixed false claims across all affected documents

## üî∂ Medium Priority Technical Debt

### 4. **Blueprint Authority Hierarchy Confusion**

**Issue:** Core [DOC_X] series vs Blueprint files have unclear authority boundaries
**Examples:**

- Testing guidance in both [DOC_9] and 11_TESTING_BLUEPRINT.md
- Edge function patterns in multiple locations
- Mobile adaptation in [DOC_8] vs implementation in blueprints

**Impact:** Developers unsure which document has authority
**Recommendation:** Establish clear hierarchy: [DOC_X] = Architectural Authority, Blueprints = Implementation Patterns

### 5. **Incomplete Management Blueprint**

**Issue:** `docs/blueprints/08b_MANAGEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE` file with no extension
**Impact:** Broken reference in project structure
**Status:** **RESOLVED** - File deleted during cleanup

### 6. **Version Inconsistencies in Documentation**

**Issue:** Different documents claim different project versions and completion status
**Examples:**

- Some docs claim edge functions 100% complete
- Others show 52% completion
- Testing framework status varies across documents

**Impact:** Unclear project status for stakeholders
**Recommendation:** Single source of truth for project status tracking

## üîπ Low Priority Technical Debt

### 7. **Historical Implementation Documents**

**Issue:** Completed implementation documents cluttering main docs
**Status:** **RESOLVED** - Moved to `docs/archive/` directory

### 8. **Redundant Quick Reference Patterns**

**Issue:** Multiple "quick reference" documents for same topics
**Status:** **RESOLVED** - Consolidated into authoritative documents

### 9. **Outdated Visual Style Specifications**

**Issue:** Extremely detailed Reddit-style UI specifications likely outdated
**Status:** **RESOLVED** - Removed outdated `Community_visual_style.md`

## üìà Documentation Health Metrics

### Before Consolidation

- **Total Files:** 39 documentation files
- **Redundant Files:** 8 files with overlapping authority
- **False Claims:** 4 files with incorrect test count claims
- **Obsolete Files:** 6 completed implementation documents
- **Authority Conflicts:** 12 instances of unclear responsibility

### After Consolidation ‚úÖ

- **Total Files:** 31 documentation files (-8 removed)
- **Redundant Files:** 3 remaining (editor blueprints)
- **False Claims:** 0 files with incorrect information
- **Obsolete Files:** 0 active (moved to archive)
- **Authority Conflicts:** 2 remaining (minor blueprint overlaps)

## üéØ Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (Next Sprint)

1. **Consolidate Editor Blueprints** - Merge 3 editor files into comprehensive guide
2. **Refactor README-B√çBLIA.md** - Break into focused documents
3. **Establish Authority Matrix** - Document which file has authority for each topic

### Medium Term (Next Month)

4. **Create Project Status Dashboard** - Single source for completion tracking
5. **Version Synchronization** - Align all version claims across documents
6. **Blueprint Responsibility Review** - Clear delineation of [DOC_X] vs Blueprint scope

### Long Term (Next Quarter)

7. **Documentation Automation** - Automate test count and status updates
8. **Regular Audit Schedule** - Quarterly documentation health checks
9. **Developer Onboarding Guide** - Clear navigation guide for documentation system

## üîç Monitoring & Prevention

### Quality Gates

- **Pre-commit hooks** should validate documentation references
- **CI/CD pipeline** should check for broken internal links
- **Monthly reviews** to prevent accumulation of technical debt

### Success Metrics

- Developer time to find relevant documentation < 2 minutes
- Zero conflicts between authoritative documents
- Automated accuracy of technical claims (test counts, version numbers)
