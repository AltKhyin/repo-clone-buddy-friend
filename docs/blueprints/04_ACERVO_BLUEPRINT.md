# **\[Blueprint\] 04: Acervo (Archive)**

Version: 1.0  
Date: June 14, 2025  
Purpose: This document is the canonical, feature-specific blueprint for the Acervo (/acervo) page. It defines the complete visual, functional, and technical specification for the platform's primary content library and discovery engine. The AI developer must reference this document for all tasks related to building the Acervo.

## **1.0 Core Principles & User Experience**

### **1.1 Feature Goal**

To provide users with a visually engaging and highly performant way to browse the entire collection of published Reviews. The core interaction is designed to help users surface the most relevant content based on their interests without ever losing sight of the full breadth of the curated collection.

### **1.2 The Core UX Mandate: Reorder, Don't Filter**

* **RULE:** This is the most critical principle for this feature. When a user selects tags, the system **MUST NOT** filter or hide any Review cards.  
* **BEHAVIOR:** Instead, the entire grid of Review cards must be **REORDERED** based on a relevance score. Reviews that match the selected tags are moved to the top of the grid. Reviews that do not match are moved to the bottom.  
* **RATIONALE:** This interaction model maintains the user's perception of a rich and complete content library, which aligns with the product's "Amostragem de ExcelÃªncia" philosophy (\[DOC\_1\]), while still providing a powerful discovery tool.

### **1.3 Core User Stories**

* **Story:** As a Practitioner, I want to navigate to the Acervo page and see all available Reviews displayed in a visually dense, masonry-style grid, sorted by the most recent publication date by default.  
* **Story:** On the Acervo page, I want to select a topic tag (categoria) to instantly reorder the grid, bringing Reviews related to that topic to the top.  
* **Story:** When I select a parent tag (categoria), I want to see its related sub-tags (subtags) appear, allowing me to further refine the relevance-based ordering of the grid.  
* **Story:** As a Practitioner, I want this reordering interaction to feel instantaneous, with no page reloads or noticeable loading delays.

### **1.4 Guiding Constitutional Documents**

* **Visuals & Styling:** All components defined MUST adhere to **\[DOC\_7\]\_VISUAL\_SYSTEM.md**.  
* **Mobile Adaptation:** All layout and component transformations MUST adhere to **\[DOC\_8\]\_MOBILE\_ADAPTATION.md**.  
* **Data Fetching:** All data fetching MUST adhere to the patterns defined in **\[DOC\_6\]\_DATA\_FETCHING\_STRATEGY.md**.  
* **Security:** All data access MUST be secured by the policies defined in **\[DOC\_4\]\_ROW\_LEVEL\_SECURITY.md**.

## **2.0 Visual & Interaction Blueprint**

### **2.1 Desktop View (\>= 1024px)**

* **Layout:** A full-screen page within the AppShell. The layout consists of two main sections:  
  1. **TagsPanel:** A horizontal bar at the top of the content area, below the page title. It displays a series of "pill" style buttons for tag selection.  
  2. **MasonryGrid:** Below the TagsPanel, a multi-column masonry grid displays all the ReviewCard components.  
* **Interaction Flow:**  
  1. **Initial State:** The grid is sorted by publication date (newest first). Only parent tags (categorias) are visible in the TagsPanel.  
  2. **Tag Selection:** User clicks a categoria pill.  
     * The grid instantly re-animates to its new order.  
     * The selected tag pill changes to its "Selected" visual state.  
     * All child tags (subtags) belonging to the selected categoria appear next to it, styled in the "Highlighted" state.  
  3. **Subtag Selection:** User can click on subtags to add them to the selection and further refine the ordering.  
  4. **Deselection:** Clicking a selected tag removes it from the selection, and the grid instantly reorders again. If no tags are selected, the grid returns to the default chronological sort.

### **2.2 Mobile View (\< 1024px)**

* **Layout:** A single-column view. The MasonryGrid reflows into a **two-column** layout.  
* **Interaction Flow Transformation:**  
  1. The persistent TagsPanel **IS REMOVED**. It is replaced by a single "Categorias" button at the top of the page.  
  2. Tapping the "Categorias" button **MUST** open the tag selection interface in a **Bottom Sheet Modal**.  
  3. The user selects tags within this modal.  
  4. A "Apply" or "View Results" button in the modal dismisses it and triggers the grid reordering animation on the page behind it.

### **2.3 Visual States for Tags**

* **Selected:** White background, dark text.  
* **Highlighted (subtags of a selected parent):** Transparent background, dim outline, white text.  
* **Unselected:** Transparent background, no outline, dim white text.

## **3.0 Front-End Architecture**

### **3.1 Component Breakdown & Contracts**

| Component Name | Type | Props Contract | State Management | Responsibilities |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| AcervoPage.js | Page | () | Manages selectedTags: string\[\]. Consumes useAcervoDataQuery. | The root component for /acervo. Fetches all initial data. Manages the state of selected tags. Orchestrates all child components. |
| TagsPanel.js | Module | { allTags: TagHierarchy, selectedTags, onTagSelect } | Manages which subtags are visible. | Renders the tag pills. Handles the logic for revealing subtags. Calls onTagSelect callback when a tag is clicked. |
| MasonryGrid.js | Module | { reviews: Review\[\] } | None | Renders the masonry layout. Uses a library like react-masonry-css to calculate grid positions. Renders a ReviewCard for each review. |
| ClientSideSorter.js | Wrapper/Hook | { reviews, selectedTags, children } | Uses useMemo for performance. | A logical component/hook that takes the full list of reviews and the selected tags, performs the sorting, and passes the sorted list down to its children. |
| ReviewCard.js | Atomic | { review: Review } | None | Renders a single, clickable card for a Review, displaying its cover art and title. |

### **3.2 State Management & Data Flow**

* **Data Fetching:** The root AcervoPage.js component is the **only** component that fetches data. It uses a single dedicated hook, useAcervoDataQuery.  
* **Client-Side State:** The array of selectedTags is the only significant piece of state. It is managed in AcervoPage.js with useState and passed down to children.  
* **Sorting Logic:** The re-sorting computation happens entirely on the client within the ClientSideSorter (or a useMemo hook inside AcervoPage).  
  * **Scoring Function:** The sorting logic must implement the simplified scoring rule: **\+1 point for every matching tag** in the selectedTags array.  
  * **Tie-Breaking:** If two Reviews have the same score, their relative order should be determined by publication date (newest first).

## **4.0 Backend Architecture & Data Flow**

### **4.1 Data Requirements**

The page requires two sets of data on initial load:

1. The complete list of all Reviews that the current user is permitted to see.  
2. The complete hierarchy of all Tags.

### **4.2 API Contract: The Consolidated Endpoint**

* **RULE:** To prevent multiple network round-trips, a single, dedicated Supabase Edge Function or RPC call must be created.  
* **Function Name:** get-acervo-data  
* **Business Logic:**  
  1. This function executes two database queries **in parallel**.  
  2. Query 1: Fetch all Reviews where status \= 'published'. This query will be subject to RLS, naturally filtering the results based on the user's access tier.  
  3. For each Review returned, perform a subquery to get all its associated tags and format them into the client-side-ready JSON object: { "Categoria": \["Subtag1"\], ... }.  
  4. Query 2: Fetch the entire Tags table to reconstruct the hierarchy on the client.  
  5. Return a single JSON object containing both the list of reviews (with pre-processed tags) and the list of all tags.  
* **Success Response (200 OK):**  
  {  
    "reviews": \[  
      {  
        "review\_id": 1,  
        "title": "...",  
        "cover\_image\_url": "...",  
        "tags\_json": { "Cardiologia": \["Estatinas"\] }  
      },  
      ...  
    \],  
    "tags": \[  
      { "tag\_id": 1, "tag\_name": "Cardiologia", "parent\_id": null },  
      { "tag\_id": 2, "tag\_name": "Estatinas", "parent\_id": 1 },  
      ...  
    \]  
  }

## **5.0 Implementation Checklist**
