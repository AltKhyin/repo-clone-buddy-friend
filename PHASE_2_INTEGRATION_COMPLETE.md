# Phase 2: Plan Customization Integration - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully integrated promotional pricing configurations from PaymentPlans table into actual payment transaction processing. This resolves the critical gap identified in the payment system audit where custom pricing was displayed in UI but not used in transactions.

## Key Implementations

### 1. Plan-Based Payment Hooks
- **useCreatePlanBasedPixPayment()**: Dynamic PIX payments with plan pricing resolution
- **useCreatePlanBasedCreditCardPayment()**: Credit card payments with promotional pricing
- **resolvePlanPricing()**: Automatic promotional config resolution with expiration handling

### 2. TwoStepPaymentForm Integration
- **Dynamic Pricing Display**: Real-time calculation from `promotional_config.finalPrice`
- **Plan-Based Transactions**: Replaces hardcoded amounts with plan ID resolution
- **Installment Calculations**: Uses resolved promotional pricing for installment display
- **Enhanced Validation**: Required billing address fields for credit card payments

### 3. Promotional Pricing Resolution
```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded amounts
amount: 200 // Static value ❌

// After: Dynamic plan-based pricing  
const finalPrice = plan.promotional_config?.finalPrice || plan.amount ✅
```

### 4. Schema Integration
- **planBasedPixPaymentSchema**: Validation for plan-based PIX payments
- **planBasedCreditCardPaymentSchema**: Validation for plan-based credit card payments
- **Automatic Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript integration with existing codebase

## Testing Coverage
- **350+ line test suite**: Comprehensive plan integration testing
- **Promotional pricing scenarios**: Active promotions, expired promotions, base pricing
- **Validation testing**: Minimum amounts, plan resolution, error handling
- **TypeScript compilation**: ✅ No errors - full type safety achieved

## Impact
- ✅ **Custom Pricing Integration**: Promotional configurations now work in actual payments
- ✅ **Database Consistency**: Single source of truth from PaymentPlans table  
- ✅ **User Experience**: Real pricing displayed matches actual transaction amounts
- ✅ **Developer Experience**: Type-safe plan-based payment processing

## Next Phase
Ready to proceed with **Phase 3: Subscription Automation** - implementing recurring payment management with pagar.me subscription plans.
